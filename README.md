# Purescriptify - an HTML to PureScript converter

[Try it out](https://purescriptify.web.app)

### Motivation

I would find various moderate to large HTML snippets online (e.g. [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) components) and curse at how tedious they are to rewrite in PureScript. No more.

### Supported

* PureScript + React (via `React.Basic.DOM`)

### Not supported (at least yet)

* `Halogen` or other flavors
* Proper `data` and `aria` attributes handling

### Contribuing

You're very welcome.
